# BitNetCNN

A PyTorch implementation of CNN architectures using BitNet principles for efficient neural networks with ternary weights quantization.

## Overview

BitNetCNN is inspired by Microsoft's BitNet research, focusing on extreme quantization for neural networks. This implementation provides multiple CNN architectures with 1.58-bit (ternary) weight quantization and configurable activation quantization, designed for efficient inference with minimal accuracy loss.

## Features

- **Ternary Weight Quantization**: Uses 1.58-bit weights (values limited to {-1, 0, 1}) with per-output-channel scaling
- **Power-of-Two Scaling**: Optional power-of-two scaling for even more efficient inference
- **Multiple Model Architectures**:
  - BitNetCNN: Basic CNN with inverted residual blocks
  - BitResNet18/50: ResNet architectures with ternary weights
  - BitMobileNetV2: MobileNetV2 architecture with ternary weights
  - BitConvNeXtv2: ConvNeXt v2 architecture with ternary weights
- **PyTorch Hub Integration**: Load pre-trained models with a single line of code
- **Multi-GPU Training**: Distributed training support with PyTorch Lightning DDP
- **Training and Inference Modes**: Supports both training with fake quantization and inference with true quantization
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Support for training with knowledge distillation from full-precision teachers
- **Compressed Checkpoints**: Pre-trained models in .zip format (8-9x smaller than .pt files)

## Quick Start with PyTorch Hub

## Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are available via PyTorch Hub and can be loaded automatically:
MNIST, c100(CIFAR-100), timnet(tiny-imagenet)

| Model | Dataset | Accuracy | Format | Size |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| BitResNet18 (Ternary) | CIFAR-100 | 71.69% | .zip | ~5 MB |
| BitNetCNN | MNIST | >99% | .pt | ~1 MB |

Load models with:

```python
import torch

# Automatic download from GitHub
model = torch.hub.load('qinhy/BitNetCNN', 'bitnet_resnet18', pretrained=True)

# Or load from local checkpoint (.zip supported!)
model = torch.hub.load('.', 'bitnet_resnet18', source='local',
                       checkpoint_path='models/bit_resnet_18_c100_ternary.pt.zip')
```

## Training

### Single GPU Training

#### BitNetCNN on MNIST

```bash
python BitNetCNN.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 128 --scale-op median
```

#### BitResNet18 on CIFAR-100 with Knowledge Distillation

```bash
python BitResNet18.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 128 --scale-op median --kd
```

#### BitMobileNetV2 on CIFAR-100

```bash
python BitMobileNetV2.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 128 --scale-op median --kd
```

### Multi-GPU Training

Train on multiple GPUs for faster training:

```bash
# Use all available GPUs
python BitResNet18.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 128 --gpus -1 --kd

# Use specific number of GPUs
python BitResNet18.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 128 --gpus 2 --kd

# Custom DDP strategy (auto-detects Windows/Linux)
python BitResNet18.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 128 --gpus 2 --strategy ddp --kd
```

**Multi-GPU Features:**
- Automatic backend selection (gloo on Windows, NCCL on Linux)
- Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) with PyTorch Lightning
- Scales training speed linearly with number of GPUs

## Using BitNet Models in Your Code

```python
from BitNetCNN import NetCNN
from common_utils import Bit, convert_to_ternary

# Create a model for training
model = NetCNN(in_channels=1, num_classes=10, scale_op="median")

# Train the model
# ...

# Convert to ternary for efficient inference
ternary_model = convert_to_ternary(model)

# For power-of-two scaling (more efficient)
from common_utils import convert_to_ternary_p2
ternary_p2_model = convert_to_ternary_p2(model)
```

## Model Architectures

### BitNetCNN
Uses an architecture inspired by MobileNetV2 with inverted residual blocks:

1. **Stem**: Initial convolution to process input images
2. **Stages**: Three inverted residual blocks with increasing channels (32→64→128→256)
3. **Head**: Global average pooling followed by a classifier

### BitResNet18/50
Standard ResNet architecture with ternary weights:

1. **Stem**: Initial convolution layer
2. **Layers**: Four layer groups with BasicBlock (ResNet18) or Bottleneck (ResNet50)
3. **Head**: Global average pooling followed by a classifier

### BitMobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 architecture with ternary weights:

1. **Stem**: Initial convolution layer
2. **Inverted Residual Blocks**: Series of inverted residual blocks with expansion factor
3. **Head**: Global average pooling followed by a classifier

### BitConvNeXtv2
ConvNeXt v2 architecture with ternary weights:

1. **Stem**: Patchify layer (4×4 patches)
2. **Stages**: Four stages with ConvNeXt blocks
3. **Head**: Global average pooling followed by a classifier

All convolution and linear layers use ternary weights for extreme parameter efficiency.

## Microsoft BitNet Inspiration

This implementation is inspired by Microsoft's BitNet research, which explores extreme quantization for neural networks. The BitNet papers demonstrate that models with 1-2 bit weights can achieve competitive performance while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Key concepts from Microsoft's BitNet research implemented here:
- 1.58-bit ternary weight quantization ({-1, 0, 1})
- Per-output-channel scaling factors
- Optional power-of-two scaling for more efficient inference
- Support for various model architectures (CNN, ResNet, MobileNetV2, ConvNeXtv2)

## Performance

The ternary models achieve competitive accuracy compared to their full-precision counterparts while significantly reducing memory footprint and computational requirements:

- **BitNetCNN**: >99% accuracy on MNIST
- **BitResNet18**: 71.69% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with knowledge distillation (ternary)
- **BitMobileNetV2**: Efficient alternative to full-precision MobileNetV2
- **BitConvNeXtv2**: State-of-the-art architecture with ternary weights

## Testing
